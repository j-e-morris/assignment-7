# Assignment 7 - Exploring R packages

### patchwork: the composer of ggplots

`patchwork` makes it simple to create complex (& beautiful!) plot layouts. Along with an extensive suite of helpful vignettes, `patchwork` has a very intuitive and readable coding syntax that makes it extremely easy to use. For example, to arrange two plots (`p1` & `p2`) side by side, you would 'add' the plots together using `p1 + p2`. I like ______. The package is accompanied by a suite of helpful vignettes that make it easy to learn how to use. I would absolutely recommend this package to anyone looking for a simple but powerful way to combine multiple plots into a single multipaneled figure.

What is the primary purpose of the package (eg, is used for plotting, reading or scraping data, manipulating data, statistical modeling, etc)? What are the things you like about the package? Are there things you donâ€™t like or wish it did differently? Was the package easy to learn how to use? Would you recommend this package to someone else?
